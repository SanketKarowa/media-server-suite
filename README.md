# media-server-suite
It's a combination of various applications to build a complete media server solution based on the multi-container Docker applications.

### Following applications are included:
- `portainer` : It is an open source tool for managing containerized applications.
- `qBittorrent-nox` :  It aims to provide an open-source software alternative to ÂµTorrent.
- `sonarr` : It is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them.
- `radarr` :  It is a movie collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users.
- `jellyfin` :  It is the volunteer-built media solution that puts _you_ in control of your media. Stream to any device from your own server, with no strings attached.
- `jackett` :  It works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps ([Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr), [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr), etc.) into tracker-site-specific http queries, parses the html response, then sends results back to the requesting software.
- `flaresolverr` :  It is an addon for `jackett`. It is a proxy server to bypass Cloudflare protection.
- `filebrowser` :  It provides a file managing interface within a specified directory.

1. Install `git`, `docker` and `docker-compose`.
    - Note : `media-server.yml` file has been tested with the `docker-compose` version `1.29.1`
2. Clone this repository.
3. Give `rw` permissions to the `downloads` directory.
4. Execute `docker-compose -f media-server.yml up -d` It'll setup the containers.
5. Once completed, navigate to `localhost:8080` for accessing the home page.
    - You have to manually complete the initial setup for all applications.
6. To remove the containers, execute `docker-compose -f media-server.yml down --volumes --remove-orphans`
